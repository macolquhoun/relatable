# Relatable

Relatable is a "cousin calculator" build to make figuring out how all your relatives fit in super easy. Try it out <a href="https://matt-sanders.github.io/relatable/">here.</a>

## To Do
  - Seriously fix the mobile user experience. Needs to be a lot easier on a phone.
  - Add sex to family options for better accuracy ( e.g. 'Mum', 'Dad' instead of 'Parent' )
  - Create the family tree from the given input

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

```
